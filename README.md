Emergency Response Simulation

Your Name: [Yosef Bekele]

This C# console application simulates an emergency response system. It generates random incidents and allows the user to select an appropriate emergency unit to respond. The simulation keeps track of a score based on the unit's ability to handle the incident, its speed, and the response time.
